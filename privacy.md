# Privacy Policy

Last updated: May 13, 2025

## 1. Introduction  
The Ringworm Scanner App (“we,” “our,” or “the App”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle information when you use our on-device skin-lesion classifier.

## 2. Information Collection & Use  
### On-Device Processing  
• All image analysis—capturing photos of skin lesions and running the vision-transformer model—happens entirely on your device.  
• We do **not** store, upload, or transmit any images or personal health data to servers, cloud services, or third parties.

### No Data Leaves Your Device  
• We do not collect, track, or share any personally identifiable information (PII).  
• We do not implement analytics or crash-reporting tools that collect usage data externally.

## 3. Data Storage & Retention  
• Images you capture are used only for immediate inference and are never saved to disk or backed up.  
• No history or logs of your scans are retained by the App.

## 4. Third-Party Services  
We do not integrate any third-party SDKs, services, or APIs that collect data. All core functionality is provided by code and ML models bundled within the App.

## 5. Security  
• Since no data leaves the device, there is no transmission risk.  
• All processing uses standard iOS security and sandboxing; we do not add any networking capabilities.

## 6. Children’s Privacy  
Our App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from anyone under 13.

## 7. Changes to This Policy  
We may update this policy when necessary. The “Last updated” date will reflect changes. Continued use of the App after updates implies acceptance.

## 8. Contact Us
